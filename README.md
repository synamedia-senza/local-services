# Local Services

The app displays a list of neighborhood services in a grid, including healthcare, social services, places of worship and utilities. If you select a place it will show it on a map.

It uses geolocation to determine the location of the device, and then searches for nearby places using Google Maps. 

## Config

To run the app, you'll need API keys for:

* [Google Maps](https://mapsplatform.google.com/lp/gmp-apis/)
* [IPData](https://ipdata.co)

You can add them to `config.js`.
